--------------------------------------------------------------------

🌥️I used the Google Geo Location API to retrieve the user's coordinates and use them in collaboration with the Open Weather API to find the local weather for the HOME page.

⛈️I used a combination of mockAPI and Open Weather API to store weather data for searched cities and display them as individual tiles, all on the DASHBOARD page.

🗺️I used the Google Map Directions API for the MAP page. The map is interactive and links to a bigger Google map for directions.
